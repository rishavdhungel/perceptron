Perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning for binary classification. One way to look at it would be to see is as a single unit of an artificial neural network or in other word a prototype for Neural Nets.

Single layer perceptron can learn a linearly seperable pattern whereas multilayer perceptron can do more complex pattern recognition.

Another way to get insight of the perceptron would be to view it from a perspective of a single neuron of animal or human brain a kinda of simulation of a one cell

inputs * weights ---> Net Input Function --> Activation Function ---> Output
